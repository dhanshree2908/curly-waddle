CNC Machine Maintenance Monitoring and Alert System

Project Description - "A CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance and longevity. One critical aspect of maintenance is timely oiling, typically required after a specified number of working hours. To facilitate this, an automated system is needed to monitor the machine's working hours and alert the operator in advance of the required maintenance."

Project Objective - "Develop an automated monitoring and alert system for a CNC machine that tracks its working hours, decrements the hours remaining until maintenance, and provides an alert when maintenance is approaching. The system should allow the user to define key parameters such as the total working hours before maintenance is needed and the alert timing."
